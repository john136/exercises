""" Features


The objective of this task is to explore the corpus, deals.txt. 


The deals.txt file is a collection of deal descriptions, separated by a new line, from which 
we want to glean the following insights:


1. What is the most popular term across all the deals?
2. What is the least popular term across all the deals?
3. How many types of guitars are mentioned across all the deals?
